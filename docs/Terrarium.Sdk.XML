              Writes a trace to the Terrarium trace window for debugging.  The Tracing routines
              take a *very* small amount of time if you're not monitoring them.  They are on the

              A creature can get skipped for a number of turns if it takes too long to execute.
              There is a limit to the time an animal can use for processing every turn which is
              calculated dynamically by the Terrarium each time it starts based on your computer's
              processing power.

              To see how long your creature takes to process, you can open the

              If you do break the limit Terrarium determines how many ticks worth of time you've gone
              over the limit and sets this property.  You can examine this property to recover from
              conditions where your creature is skipped for a given number of turns.  This is useful
              since you may not receive events that fire while during the time your creature's turn

              The radius scanned by your creature is dependent upon the number of points

             <para>
              Because of camouflage and the random aspect of hiding vs. being seen by another
              creature, multiple calls to Scan might returns different results.  However,

              It is recommended that you hold onto the OrganismState objects, determine your

              Attacking is asynchronous so you'll need to handle the AttackCompleted
              event in order to get the status of your attack.  A single attack might
              not kill a target enemy so you should detect if the enemy is still
              alive and call BeginAttacking once per round until the target creature
              is either dead or has escaped.
